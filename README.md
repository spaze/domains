# tld-cz.txt
Unofficial and incomplete lists of various domain names, for research purposes only.

The CZ list is an append-only list because there's no easy way to filter out expired domains, see [this issue](https://github.com/spaze/domains/issues/2). [@k47](https://twitter.com/kaja47) ran a scan and [says](https://twitter.com/kaja47/status/1108100691434917888) roughly half of the domains are dead. Consider yourself warned.

# whois-cz.csv
Registrant ID and date of expiration from the Whois for tld-cz.txt. Contains also some historical data.  
If a domain from tld-cz.txt is not in whois-cz.txt with expire_at > current_date it should be considered as not existing.

## Want to contribute?
Have a list of domains you'd like to add? Feel free to create a pull request!

Here's a short how-to:
1. Only 2nd-level domains *foo.tld*, no *bar.foo.tld* (lines should match `^[a-z0-9-]+\.tld$`, so for example `grep --only-matching --perl-regexp "[a-z0-9-]+\.cz" data.txt > yourlist.txt`)
2. Use LF newlines, not CRLF (`dos2unix yourlist.txt`)
3. Generate a new list, for example with `cat tld-cz.txt yourlist.txt | sort | uniq > tld-cz-new.txt`
4. Review `tld-cz-new.txt`, rename to `tld-cz.txt`, pull request it

Thank you!
